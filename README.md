burro-engine
============

This is the README for the Burro Engine version 0.0. 

This is an experiment where I tried to write an interactive fiction
game engine rather like Twine, except using GTK3 instead of the browser
as the rendering engine.

Burro Engine uses an embedded Guile interpreter: the game scripts
are written in a language called Scheme.

It builds and runs, but, it is definitely an alpha.  See the TODO.org
for information on what needs to be done.

It comes with a default story, called "Fancy Free".  The game is
"game/game.burro" which you can run with the "run-uninstalled.sh"
script or by selecting game.burro from the File Open in the menu.
