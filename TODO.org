#+TITLE: TODO for Burro Engine

* Engine
** Audio file unpacking
   Probably go with libopusfile for this, because it is very simple.
** Audio streaming
** Better directory and game loading handling
   Where should we be looking for jpg, png, and opus files?
   What is doctrinaire?  What is safe?
** API vs internal linking
   Need to do the whole __visibility__((default)__,
   __declspec(dllexport) thing.
** Guile port handling
** The big BG rewrite
   BG is a mess.
** Debugger
*** BG properties
*** Textbox properties and action hotspots
*** watch
** Make pretty
** Wisp support
** VRAM stability
   When VRAM slots are overwritten, it needs to invalidate BG
   or audio
** Useful backtrace
* Scheme library
** Twine helper functions
* Game
** Prototype game in Twine
** Convert to Burro
