#+TITLE: TODO for Burro Engine

* Engine
** Autoconf / Automake
** Audio file unpacking
   Probably go with libvorbisfile for this, because it is very simple.
** Better directory and game loading handling
   Assume all the game data is in a game directory, and there is a
   top-level 'main.scm'
** API vs internal linking
** Guile port handling
* Scheme library
** SXML to Pango GMarkup conversion
   Also, add custom hotspot tag to GMarkup
** Textbox hotspot mouse click and mouse over
** Twine library
* Game
** Prototype game in Twine
** Convert to Burro
