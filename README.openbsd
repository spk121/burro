It seems to build with the following invocation..

AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15 ./bootstrap.sh
./configure CC=clang
gmake

I'm sorry that there is non-portable make in this.  It is not my fault.
It comes from GLIB.

I hope to also add support for OpenBSD's sound server, instead of Pulseaudio.
