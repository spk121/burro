     audio defines and functionality

    This is a simple audio stream model.

    It has several parts.

    NOTE: the frequency, amplitude and duration of a sound created by
    a theoretical instrument.  This is a 4-element
    - an INSTRUMENT ID, from 1 to 128
    - frequency in Hz
    - duration in seconds
    - amplitude, a positive number, where 0.0 is silent and 1.0 is
      maximum volume

    INSTRUMENT: These are the data that represents how an theoretical
    instrument (string, piano, brass, reed, etc) converts a NOTE into
    a WAVE waveform.  This audio engine has a rather simple instrument
    engine.  It is an Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release engine.
    - Duration of attack, decay, and release, in seconds
    - Frequency adjustment of initial, attack, sustain, and release:
      a ratio, where 1.0 is the frequency of the given NOTE
    - Amplitude adjustments of attack and sustain. A ratio, where
      1.0 is the amplitude of the given NOTE.
    - Amplitude of the 1st through 6th harmonic.  A ratio, where
      1.0 is the amplitude relative to the fundamental frequency.
    - A noise flag
    - A duty cycle, from 0.1 to 0.9, with 0.5 meaning that the
      period of a sinusoid is made from two equal half-periods.
      0.1 meaning that the 1st half period of 10% of the period length
      whilst the 2nd half period is 90% of the period length, etc.

    INSTRUMENT MAP: a hash table that associates a INSTRUMENT ID from 1 to 128
    with a INSTRUMENT.

    WAVE: a signed raw 16-bit monophonic waveform. In Guile these are
    bytevectors that hold signed 16-bit data in native endianness.
    WAVEs can be loaded from a file or generated with a NOTE+INSTRUMENT.

    SOUNDS: These are WAVEs with the addition property of a start
    time.  The start time property which says they should be played
    either as soon as possible, or at some specific time in the
    future.  For SOUNDs with a start time, that start time is
    expressed in seconds relative to the PULSEAUDIO CLOCK.

    SOUND LIST: This is a list of all the sounds that have been
    enqueued for playback.

    At regular intervals, the pulseaudio engine will request a about a
    millisecond's worth of audio to be played back, at which time the
    audio model will generate that audio from the SOUNDs in the SOUND
    LIST.  When a SOUND has finished playing, it will automatically be
    removed from the SOUND LIST.

    PULSEAUDIO CLOCK: a monotically increasing (but not 100% stable)
    time in seconds, reported by the Pulseaudio subsystem.  Not to be
    confused with the LOOP CLOCK.
