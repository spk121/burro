Z-LEVEL ROUTINES

All code on this level, other than main, should only interact with the
abstracted interfaces from the Y-level routines.

The SWIG wrapper interface generator uses the *.i files to create the
guileapi.c program, which provides a Guile interface to the abstracted
interfaces from the Y-level routines.

All the Guile code is on this level.  The Guile code contains the game
logic.
