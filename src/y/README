Y-LEVEL ROUTINES

Anything that interacts with the system is on this level: audio,
video, controls, and sockets.  Also anything that manipulates raw data
is on this level.

It provides the API used by the z-level routines.

Any call to a system function that has a failure condition that isn't
explicitely should be pushed down the to x-level.
